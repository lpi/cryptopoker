# cryptopoker
Cryptopoker is a site for playing home games. For higher stakes games (or for the truely paranoid) - crytopoker can be operated in a "secure mode", in which the "Mental Poker" algorithm is used to shuffle the cards. This results in a provably fair poker game, where inappropiate card manipulation or observation is impossible. 

There are some downsides to operating in the secure mode - such as the fact that dealing out cards will take an extra second or so. Also, if a disconnect occurs, it would become impossible to play out the rest of the hand.
